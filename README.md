55chan - A fork of vichan
========================================================

About
------------
55chan is a fork of vichan, a great imageboard package, we'll do our best to actively build on it.

Requirements
------------
1.	PHP >= 5.4 (we still try to keep compatibility with php 5.3 as much as possible)
        PHP 7.0 is explicitly supported. PHP 7.2 works as well, but may cause as yet unreported bugs.
2.	MySQL/MariaDB server
3.	[mbstring](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php) 
4.	[PHP GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php)
5.	[PHP PDO](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php)
6.	A Unix-like OS, preferrably FreeBSD or Linux

We try to make sure 55chan is compatible with all major web servers. 55chan does not include an Apache ```.htaccess``` file nor does it need one.

### Recommended
1.	MySQL/MariaDB server >= 5.5.3
2.	ImageMagick (command-line ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick preferred).
3.	[APC (Alternative PHP Cache)](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php),
	[XCache](http://xcache.lighttpd.net/) or
	[Memcached](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.memcached.php)

Contributing
------------
You can contribute to 55chan by:
*	Developing patches/improvements/translations and using GitHub to submit pull requests
*	Providing feedback and suggestions
*	Writing/editing documentation

Installation
-------------
1.	Download and extract 55chan to your web directory or get the latest
	development version with:

        git clone git://github.com/55chan/55chan.git
	
2.	Navigate to ```install.php``` in your web browser and follow the
	prompts.
3.	vichan should now be installed. Log in to ```mod.php``` with the
	default username and password combination: **admin / password**.

Please remember to change the administrator account password.

Upgrade
-------
To upgrade from any version of Tinyboard or vichan:

Either run ```git pull``` to update your files, if you used git, or
backup your ```inc/instance-config.php```, replace all your files in place
(don't remove boards etc.), then put ```inc/instance-config.php``` back and
finally run ```install.php```.

To migrate from a Kusaba X board, use http://github.com/vichan-devel/Tinyboard-Migration

Support
--------
vichan is still beta software -- there are bound to be bugs. If you find a
bug, please report it.

CLI tools
-----------------
There are a few command line interface tools, based on Tinyboard-Tools. These need
to be launched from a Unix shell account (SSH, or something). They are located in a ```tools/```
directory.

You actually don't need these tools for your imageboard functioning, they are aimed
at the power users. You won't be able to run these from shared hosting accounts
(i.e. all free web servers).

Oekaki
------
vichan makes use of [wPaint](https://github.com/websanova/wPaint) for oekaki. After you pull the repository, however, you will need to download wPaint separately using git's `submodule` feature. Use the following commands:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To enable oekaki, add all the scripts listed in `js/wpaint.js` to your `instance-config.php`.

WebM support
------------
Read `inc/lib/webm/README.md` for information about enabling webm.

vichan API
----------
vichan provides by default a 4chan-compatible JSON API. For documentation on this, see:
https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan-API/ .

License
--------
See [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
